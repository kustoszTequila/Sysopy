*** KOMENTARZ ***
Dla wariantu blokowego podział na małą liczbe wątków skutkuje skróceniem czasu działania programu, jednak dla większej ich ilośći efekt jest odwrotny.
Dla wariantu "numbers" większa liczba wątków zawsze wiąże się z dłuższym czasem działania programu, ponieważ liczby nie są rozłożone jednostajnie, więc niektóre wątki mają znacznie cięższą pracę do wykonania. 
Generalnie wariant blokowy radzi sobie lepiej niż "numbers".
